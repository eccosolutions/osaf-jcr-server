- review: compliance to deltaV
- reflecting feature-sets
- baseline/activity not respected yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
todo webdav/transaction package
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- review naming of the lock scopes. 'global','local' are not correct in
  this context.
- repository transactions ('global') are only possible with jackrabbit, where
  the session represents the XAResource itself.
  since j2ee explicitely requires any usertransaction to be completed
  upon the end of the servletes service method.
  general review necessary....

- SearchResource should extend DavResource
- basicquery as defined by the internet draft not respected

general 

- undo incomplete changes in case of exception
- review GET/PUT for JCR properties
- multistatus fuer lock, copy, move, delete, proppatch wherever required.
- DAV:supported-live-property-set
- timeout: remove expired locks/subscriptions
- improve definition methods/compliance-class
- methods/compliance-class auf der root resoure vs *
- OPTIONS to *-request-uri (according to RFC 2616)

ordering

- respect Position header with creation of new collection members by
  PUT, COPY, MKCOL requests

lock

- implement session-scoped locks. this includes:
  > uncommenting supported-locks entry
  > build caching mechanism for session in case of session-scoped locks.
  > retrieval of cached sessions (currently not possible from IfHeader).
  > open issue in JCR: scope of lock cannot be retrieved.

- JCR lock-token currently not checked for compliance with RFC2518. If the
  token is modified accordingly, setting the lock-token to the subsequent
  session (currently in the WebdavRequestImpl) must be aware of that change....

- transaction locks
  - lock returned upon lock-discovery 
  - remove after timeout (>> releasing cached sessions)
  - define reasonable timeout or make timeout configurable
  - createLock must respect existing locks in the subtree, for lock is always deep.

observation

- make sure all expired subscriptions are removed.
- subscription: reasonable default/max timeout make it configurable...

versioning

- VersionItemResource. review regarding definition of a version resource 
  rfc3253: 'A "version resource", or simply "version", is a resource 
  that contains a copy of a particular state (content and dead properties) of a 
  version-controlled resource. A version is created by "checking in" a checked-out 
  resource. The server allocates a distinct new URL for each new version, and 
  this URL will never be used to identify any resource other than that version. 
  The content and dead properties of a version never change.'

- Additional VERSION-CONTROL Semantics with workspace not implemented.
